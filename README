This app is a simple app to combine some tutorials and display some of the technologies we us.

Things in here:

1) The DJango Tutorial with some goodness added.
2) Tastypie tutorial plus more.
3) Using unit tests with Django and Tastypie
4) A simple tutorial (not from another site/tech) that show's how to
  a) Use our Multi-authentication to create and access a Tastypie REST API


Some basic assumptions:
  1) You know stuff like MySQL, Git, some basic Linux/Unix
  2) You can handle some basic python stuff like virtualenv, pip
  3) You can figure out some of the basic settings for DJango on your own.  Some I'll cover, others you need to sort
  4) ?

Getting Started and Setting it all up.
  1) Checkout the PollProj repository.
  2) Create virtual env
  4) Activate virtualenv
  5) Install stuff
  6) You will need a MySQL instance with a database called 'poll', a username 'poll' and a password 'poll314' (yes that's pollpie)
    - Assuming you're on localhost, your DATABASES setting in your Django settings.py file looks like
      DATABASES = {
          'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
              'NAME': 'poll',
              'USER': 'poll',
              'PASSWORD': 'poll314',
              'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
              'PORT': '3306',
          }
      }
