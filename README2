This is an in-depth description of the the apps, technologies contained in this tutorial.

1) Poll app: I'm not going into detail on the Poll app, I've just left the code in here as a reference.  You may notice that I've added little bits
here and there like __unicde__ functions in the Models, and changed tests, but those are exploratory.  For in depth docs on Poll app, use Django's
documentation, you'll get much more out of it.

2) The Tastypie tutorial app.  This is also roughly the same as the Tastypie tutorial.
Plesae refer here: http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
The reason I'm keeping this app in the tutorial is more for the tests than for the Model/API stuff. There are some different testing elements that
I've added to show some simple serialization/deserialization for tests, and how to run them.  I've added comments in the code to show these. Those are
in tests/test_api.py
