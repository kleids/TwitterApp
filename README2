Tastypie Tutorial App for Django, basic Python, Celery, Tastypie, and Chef.

What the TwitterApp does
1) Setup a simple Django project
2) Shows how to set up a simple Django Model
2) Setup a simple Tastypie API
3) Run tests against your model and your API.  Simple tests and some mock tests
4) Have a python object that Authenticates with Twitter and gets data about your Tweets and Twitter Handle associated with those Tweets. and stores them
   using your DJango model.
5) Have a simple Celery app that runs the python-twitter sync-up every five minutes (if you let it).
6) Have a simple web app that uses HTML and Javascript (no Django views) to call the Tastypie API's to get your Tweet and Twitter user data and display them
in a VERY simple app.
7) Deploy the entire app and stack using Chef and Vagrant which includes:
  - Redis to handle messaging for Celery
  - Mysql install, setup databases and users
  - Django and uwsgi
  - A Simple Nginx config
  - Setup a Virtual Environment
  - Get the code and MOST dependencies from GitHub
8) Run some final config steps to get data and run your app.

Assumptions:
- You can use some unix-like environment.  I've only tested this on OSX and a Vagrant Precise64 environment.
- You can do some basic stuff with Git.
- You know a little bit about software development.  Databases. Stuff like that.

So let's do all that.  We're going to go out of order from above and get it up and running, then walk through all of the app bits.


1) Get the code and stuff.
  a) Create a directory where you want your stuff.
    - run 'git clone ???repository????'
  b) Now you've got some code! Yay.  Unfortunately, you're not quite done.
2) Now 'cd' into the TwitterApp directory.
  - Sidenote: I've got the Chef repository and the App Repository all together.  This isn't the cleanest way to go, but for a training app, it's ok.
  a) You can now see various bits of the app that I've all put in the root directory more for simplicity than for cleanliness. Things to note:
    1) README!
    2) The 'cheftwitter' directory.  This contains all of the chef recipes, roles, environments, cookbooks that you'll need.  It also contains the Vagrantfile.
       I'm not going to go into Chef in detail until later, but the Vagrantfile should be all you need to get the whole kit running.
